# BunPass

Microservice for [DaylightX](https://github.com/BusterWarn/DaylightX) built with Bun.
Like a compass, but with a bun instead of a com. ðŸ‘¯

Use `/api/locations` to get recommended locations.
To get coordinates, `/location?place=Kiruna%2C Sweden` :
```json
{
  "lat": "68.1666670",
  "lon": "19.5000000",
  "name": "Kiruna kommun",
  "display_name": "Kiruna kommun, Norrbottens lÃ¤n, Sverige"
}
```
